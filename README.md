# Calculator
This is a Python-based calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and exponential functions.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced mathematical operations: trigonometric functions (cosine, hyperbolic cosine, tangent, hyperbolic tangent, sine, hyperbolic sine), logarithmic functions (logarithm, base 2 logarithm, base 10 logarithm, natural - logarithm), exponential functions (e^x, x^2).
- Clear button (CE) to clear the last entry.
- All clear button (C) to clear the entire display.
- Plus/minus button to negate the current entry.
- Decimal button for decimal point input.
- Pi and tau buttons to input the mathematical constants π and τ, respectively.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/username/calculator.git`
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory using the command: `cd calculator`
3. Run the application using the command: `python calculator.py`

## Usage
1. The calculator GUI will open upon running the application.
2. Enter the desired numerical values using the number pad.
3. Select the desired operation button (+, -, ×, ÷) to perform the corresponding operation.
4. For advanced mathematical operations, select the corresponding button on the calculator.
5. Use the clear button (CE) to clear the last entry and the all clear button (C) to clear the entire display.
6. The result will be displayed in the main display area of the calculator.
